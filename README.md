# About

This website is no longer in use so I made it public. It's written using Next.js (a React-based Framework) and was used to handle memberships and event signups for a guild known as "Not Dead Yet" in the popular MMORPG game, World of Warcraft.

The website is currently still live at the time of writting this, although not in use, and it most likely won't be aroundf forever:
